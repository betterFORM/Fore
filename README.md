# Fore - a forms toolkit for HTML5

Fore is the sucessor of betterFORM 5 XForms engine. It uses a distributed MVC architecture that spans client- and server-side for maximum security and reliability. But instead of using abstract controls like XForms Fore uses HTML5 as its foundation for building the UI. This essentially means that authors are free to choose from the variety of CSS and JavaScript frameworks to create their UI.
