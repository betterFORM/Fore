/**
 * A Reference Finder analyzes a given XPath expression and extracts all
 * absolute and relative references to other nodes which may affect the value of
 * the expression. This is needed for dependency tracking and recalculation.
 * <p/>
 * Special care has to taken with regard to the following points:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A reference finder is expected to handle predicates correctly, e.g. for
 * <code>parent[child!='']</code> it is supposed to return
 * <code>parent[child!='']</code> <i>and</i> <code>parent/child</code> as
 * references since the value of the selected parent as well as any child may
 * affect the value of the whole expression.</li>
 * <li>A reference finder is expected to handle all occurrences of the
 * <code>instance()</code> function coorrectly, i.e. it has to be handled like
 * an absolute location path.</li>
 * </ol>
